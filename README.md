# Nanowire-Simulation
This project simulate the a Nanowire of 100 & 20 nm when the electrons pass through.

Different languages are used to address different tasks.
Gmsh is used to generate the graphic and geometric object, generating the GEO file, and then providing the 3D finite element mesh.
Tibercad is a simulation environment. You set different simulation parameters (for example the Doping density, Range of Gate Voltage, electron mobility) and then you run the simulation.
Paraview is used to visualize the results graphically. Is created a file every voltage step.

The Canvas presentation shows the results and the topic also in theoric terms.

This project was part of the course "Nanoelectronics" run by professor Alessio Gagliardi in TUM, Munich, Germany.
